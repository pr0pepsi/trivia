Missing elements in the project - https://www.figma.com/file/62Go1IkGjYnUTVIQ5OVJKd/Trivia-challenge?node-id=1%3A19 
    
    - There is no screen or element showing the choice of the difficulty level. (Solution: Screen was designed by me)
    - There is no exported .png files with the background of individual screens. (Solution: I created the components with specific svg elements that wrapped the screen)
